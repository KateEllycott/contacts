  <p>Suppose you are building a <strong>Forex Broker</strong> application. Forex broker has two commands which are <code class="java">buy</code> and <code class="java">sell</code>.&nbsp; The user gives an input sequence which is the amount of money(Option) to be bought and sold. If the user has given a positive number it is to be bought. if the user has given a negative number, that amount should be sold.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>Use the following guidelines.&nbsp;</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Don't change the provided code.</li> 
   <li>if the user amount is X&gt; 0, the X amount should be bought. buy command will print <code class="java">X was bought</code>.</li> 
   <li>if the user amount is X&lt;&nbsp;0, the X amount should be sold. sell command will print <code class="java">X was sold</code>.</li> 
   <li>The user will give only three inputs.&nbsp;</li> 
  </ul>
